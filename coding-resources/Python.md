Python
=======

Python is a very helpful tool when it comes to parsing files for specific values of interest, 
plotting data, and/or data manipulation. Many of the in-house packages designed in our group 
are written in Python, so learning to understand the language should be a huge help for new 
computational scientists.

Python itself has a [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) that will be helpful 
for the installation and basic use.


For using Python for scientific/chemical purposes, the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) 
has very helpful workshops that implement Python to parse through files, collect the data of interest, 
plot that data, and more. You can find the MolSSI resources [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).
